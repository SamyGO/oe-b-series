# The strace-4.5.14-avr32.patch conflicts with some other patches.
# These patches are primarly for the ARM and SuperH, so we'll just
# not use them when building for the AVR32.
# The avr32 patch also includes the drop-ctl-proc.patch
# The AVR32 patches are from http://avr32linux.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/STrace
