# Example of an unencrypted (no WEP or WPA) wireless connection
# that connects to any available access point:
#
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
	wireless_mode managed
	wireless_essid any
#
#
# Same as above but locked to a specific access point:
#
#iface wlan0 inet dhcp  
#	wireless_mode managed
#	wireless-essid some-essid
#
# A WEP encrypted connection locked to a specific access point:
#
#iface wlan0 inet dhcp  
#	wireless-essid some-essid
#	wireless-key s:My-PlainText-Password
#	wireless-mode managed                  
#
# A WPA1 or WPA2 encrypted connection locked to a specific access point.
# This is the best option for non-roaming, single-network usage.
# Note that your card may require a firmware update to use WPA. 
# Some distributions install a temporary volatile firmware update on ifup.
