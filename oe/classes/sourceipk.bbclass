# sourceipk.bbclass enables the creation of an ipk file that contains the
# sources used during the build.  The sources contained in the ipk are the
# patched sources before configuration has been done.
#
# This class is used to provide an easy method to ship the corresponding
# sources for a package to end users so that they can install them on their
# host or target systems.
#
# This package uses the following variables to control its operations:
#   - CREATE_SRCIPK         = When set to 1 this variable indicates that 
#                             a source ipk should be generated for the package.
#   - SRCIPK_INSTALL_DIR    = This variable indicates the directory to install
#                             the sources into.
#   - SRCIPK_PACKAGE_ARCH   = This variable allows specific recipies to
#                             specify an architecture for the sourcetree
#                             package is "all" is not appropriate
#
# The default installation directory for the sources is:
#   /usr/src/${PN}-src
#
# By setting the SRCIPK_INSTALL_DIR this default can be changed to any
# location desired.  When combined with the opkg -o option this allows for the
# system building to specify a relative package install location to the
# install root given to opkg.  Each source ipk can have a different directory.
# 
# Creation of the source ipk can be controlled per package by setting
# CREATE_SRCIPK = "1" in the package recipe or by setting
# CREATE_SRCIPK_pn-<package name> = "1" in your local.conf
#
#TODO: 
# Need to figure out how to use ipkg-build in this class.
# I tried adding it as a dependency for the do_create_srcipk
# task using:
#   do_create_srcipk[depends] += "ipkg-utils-native:do_populate_sysroot"
# But then there is a circular dependency between sourcipk.bbclass and
# ipkg-utils-native.  Until I can figure out how to resolve this
# circular dependency I am extracting the needed pieces from ipkg-build
# into this class and building the source ipk myself.

# Create the source ipk file.  The ipk is manually created here instead

# to the list of packages to be created that package would be lost.
