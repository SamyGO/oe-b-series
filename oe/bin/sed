# Sed portability notes
# - SuSv3
#    - Only -e, -f, and -n are standard options
# - Linux
#    - -i argument is of the form -i[ext]
#    - extended regular expressions argument is -r
# - Mac OSX
#    - -i argument is of the form -i [ext]
#    - extended regular expressions argument is -E
#
# Here we support a limited subset of the available sed capabilities,
# ensuring that all those supported by this script can be utilized
# regardless of the current platform.
#
# We accept -n, -e, -f, and -i with no backup extension.  We support
# extended regular expressions using the -r argument.  Note that extended
# regular expressions support may not be retained, depending upon the
# capabilities of the other platforms we wish to support, and we may need
# to reimplement -i internally in this script on some platforms.
