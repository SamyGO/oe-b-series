.SH NAME
BitBake \- simple tool for the execution of tasks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bitbake
.RI [ options ] " packagenames"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B bitbake
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBbitbake\fP is a program that executes the specified task (default is 'build')
for a given set of BitBake files.
.br
It expects that BBFILES is defined, which is a space separated list of files to
be executed. BBFILES does support wildcards.
.br
Default BBFILES are the .bb files in the current directory.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show version of program.
.TP
.B \-bBUILDFILE, \-\-buildfile=BUILDFILE
execute the task against this .bb file, rather than a package from BBFILES.
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-continue
continue as much as possible after an error. While the target that failed, and
those that depend on it, cannot be remade, the other dependencies of these
targets can be processed all the same.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-tryaltconfigs
continue with builds by trying to use alternative providers where possible.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-force
force run of specified cmd, regardless of stamp status
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-interactive
drop into the interactive mode also called the BitBake shell.
.TP
.B \-cCMD, \-\-cmd=CMD
Specify task to execute. Note that this only executes the specified task for
the providee and the packages it depends on, i.e. 'compile' does not implicitly
call stage for the dependencies (IOW: use only if you know what you are doing).
Depending on the base.bbclass a listtasks task is defined and will show
available tasks.
.TP
.B \-rFILE, \-\-read=FILE 
read the specified file before bitbake.conf
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
output more chit-chat to the terminal
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-debug
Increase the debug level. You can specify this more than once.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-dry-run
don't execute, just go through the motions
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-parse-only
quit after parsing the BB files (developers only)
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-disable-psyco
disable using the psyco just-in-time compiler (not recommended)
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-show-versions
show current and preferred versions of all packages
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-environment
show the global or per-package environment (this is what used to be bbread)
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-graphviz
emit the dependency trees of the specified packages in the dot syntax
.TP
.B \-IIGNORED\_DOT\_DEPS, \-\-ignore-deps=IGNORED_DOT_DEPS
Stop processing at the given list of dependencies when generating dependency
graphs. This can help to make the graph more appealing
.TP
.B \-lDEBUG_DOMAINS, \-\-log-domains=DEBUG_DOMAINS
Show debug logging for the specified logging domains
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-profile
profile the command and print a report
